# PROJECT1-Money_manager
This project was made using ruby, psql and sinatra.

the app has been made to keep track of purchases against a hardcoded budget.

the app is far from perfect but does the tasks required.

to run this project;

*first create a database in PSQL with the name "money_mgmt".

then in your terminal run the controller.rb with ruby, this will create the site at localhost:4567/

hopefully from this point it should be self explanatory but if you have any questions please contact me.
